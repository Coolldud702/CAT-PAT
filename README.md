# CAT-PAT
In grade 12 I was working on a CAT PAT (Computer Applications Technology Practical Assessment Task), which is a year-long school project that tests my ability to apply various computer skills to solve real-world problems. The project is divided into phases, and this is Phase 3, which focuses on HTML. In this phase, I'm designed and coding a functional website using HTML (and some CSS) to present my research and findings from the previous phases. Itâ€™s all about creating a user-friendly, well-structured site that effectively communicates my chosen topic. This is where everything comes together visually, and I get to showcase both my content and technical skills in web design.
