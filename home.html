<p>What are the benefits and ethical issues of Electric Vehicle Technician</p>



<font face ="Times New Roman"> <h2>Abstract</h2></font>

<p>he rise of electric vehicles (EVs) addresses rising oil costs and carbon emissions. While EVs offer independence from oil and zero greenhouse gas emissions, challenges persist. These include costly infrastructure, sparse charging stations, limited range causing range anxiety, and battery performance. Solutions entail expanding charging infrastructure, increasing stations, employing battery swapping, and enhancing battery technology. Governments can incentivize EV adoption through tax credits, subsidies, and infrastructure investments. Collaboration between industry and governments is vital for overcoming challenges, promoting EV adoption, and curbing carbon emissions
and air pollution.</P>
