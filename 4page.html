 pie chart titled “Gender Distribution” based on the information provided:<br>
Title: Gender Distribution<br>
Categories:<br>
Male: The largest section (coloured yellow) represents males, with 13 entries.<br>
Female: The second-largest section (coloured orange) represents females, with 10 entries.<br>
Prefer not to say: A small green sliver indicates that 2 respondents preferred not to disclose their gender.<br>
Other: An even smaller red sliver represents 1 respondent who identified as “Other.”<br>
<br><br>
Interpretation<br>
The majority of respondents in this dataset are male, followed by females. A few respondents chose not to specify their gender, and there was one respondent who identified as “Other.”

the bar graph titled “Do You Know What Is a Green Job?” based on the information provided:
<br>
Title: Do You Know What Is a Green Job?<br>
X-Axis Categories: “Yes,” “No,” and “Maybe”<br>
Y-Axis: The y-axis represents the count of responses (though the exact numerical scale is not clearly labelled).<br>
Data:<br>
“Yes”: The tallest bar corresponds to the “Yes” category, indicating that the majority of respondents know what a green job is.<br>
“No”: The shorter bar represents the “No” category, suggesting that fewer respondents do not know what a green job is.<br>
“Maybe”: The bar of similar height to the “No” response indicates some uncertainty among respondents.<br>
<br><br>
Interpretation<br>
The majority of respondents in this survey know what a green job is, while a smaller number are uncertain or do not know. It’s essential to consider the context and sample size when interpreting these results.
